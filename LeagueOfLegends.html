          <p class="blogpost-text">G2 Esports have signed iconic bot laner Martin 'Rekkles' Larsson after an impressive 2020 Worlds performance with Fnatic. This now finalises G2's LEC roster after the departure of Luka 'Perkz' Perkovic to North American LCS Spring Split champions Cloud 9 Esports. This move reunites Caps and Rekkles after their successful year together on Fnatic in 2018. This move marks the end of Rekkles' long 8 year tenure at Fnatic. “My goal has always been to prove myself as one of the most successful players in the game, and despite having 4 EU titles and a Worlds silver medal, I am not satisfied, It is with this in mind that I have joined G2. They are a great organisation and a great brand. Winning Worlds is as much of an ultimate goal for them as it is for me. So, when they asked me to join, it was a no-brainer.” Rekkles said. “Rekkles will create his own path here and I know the G2ARMY will support him along the way. He promised he would win Worlds. And he will. With G2,” said G2 owner Carlos ‘ocelote’ Rodríguez Santiago.</p>

Despite the last few year's results I've loved my time in Europe, and deciding to change to NA was definitely not an easy decision. Also can understand how some fans will be disappointed in seeing me leave EU, - I just hope you'll be able to support me regardless as I aim to prove myself internationally again next year. This will be my time to achieve results." </p>
